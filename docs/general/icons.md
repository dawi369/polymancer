# Icons

You only need to design two (or three) high-resolution PNG files. Save these in your project's `assets/` or `assets/images/` folder.

## icon.png (iOS and general fallback)

- **Size**: 1024x1024 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- Rule: No transparency. The background must be a solid color.

## adaptive-icon.png (Android foreground)

- **Size**: 1024x1024 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- Rule: Must have a transparent background. The logo must fit within the center safe zone to avoid clipping.

## adaptive-background.png (optional)

If your Android background is a complex gradient or pattern, create a 1024x1024 PNG for it. If your background is just a solid color, you don't need this file.
